### DWH Implementation

- In a data warehousing environment, effective data modeling is essential for structuring the database schema to efficiently store and analyze data. Dimension tables form the foundation of the data warehouse, providing descriptive attributes and context for measures stored in fact tables. These dimensions include entities such as students, student grades, branches, instructors, graduates, courses, tracks, exams, and questions. Each dimension table outlines specific attributes relevant to its entity, facilitating comprehensive data analysis.

- The fact table, on the other hand, captures transactional data pertaining to student activities within the educational institution. It records essential metrics and measures associated with student performance, progress, and interactions. Utilizing foreign keys referencing dimension tables, the fact table establishes relationships and provides context for recorded transactions. Notable transactional details include student ID, track ID, branch ID, exam ID, and transaction date, enabling thorough drill-down analysis. Additional attributes such as creation timestamp and source system code are included for auditing and data lineage purposes.

- Furthermore, Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) techniques are employed to manage changes to dimension attributes over time. These techniques ensure historical accuracy and facilitate tracking of changes in dimensional data. Each dimension table may exhibit varying SCD types, distinguishing columns as changing, historical, or fixed. This systematic approach enhances the efficiency and reliability of the data warehousing system, enabling comprehensive data management and analysis.

## Tools

1. Utilize Draw.io, an online platform, for crafting Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and Database schemas.
2. Employ SQL Server Management Studio for the execution of database implementations.
3. Leverage SQL Server Reporting Service and Visual Studio to implement comprehensive reports.
4. Utilize SQL Server Management Studio and SQL Server Integration Service for the establishment of Datawarehouses.
5. Utilize Microsoft Power BI Desktop for the creation of dynamic Dashboards.
6. Employ Microsoft Fabric (Power BI Service) and Microsoft Power BI Desktop for seamless integration with Paginated Reports generated by SSRS.
7. Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the development of the website's Front-End.
8. Implement ASP.NET Core 6 along with Entity Framework Core version 6.0.2, Entity Framework Core.SqlServer Version 6.0.26, EntityFrameworkCore.Tools Version 6.0.26 packages, and EF Core Power Tools for the design of the website's Back-End.
